# Security Best Practices

This document outlines additional critical security measures that will be implemented across the application to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## 1. Input Validation

All data received from clients via API requests (including body, query parameters, and URL params) must be rigorously validated on the server-side before being used. This is the first line of defense against a wide range of attacks, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and command injection.

-   **Strategy:** We will use a schema-based validation library, such as `zod` or `class-validator`.
-   **Implementation:**
    1.  For each API endpoint, a validation schema will be defined that corresponds to its `Dto` (Data Transfer Object).
    2.  A validation middleware will run before the main route handler.
    3.  This middleware will check the incoming request data against the schema.
    4.  If validation fails, the request will be rejected immediately with a `400 Bad Request` status code and a descriptive error message indicating the validation failure.
    5.  Only after successful validation will the request be passed to the business logic layer.

## 2. Password Hashing

As detailed in the `auth_strategy.md` document, all user passwords will be hashed using a strong, adaptive, and salted hashing algorithm.

-   **Chosen Algorithm:** **bcrypt**.
-   **Reasoning:** bcrypt is a widely-used, battle-tested algorithm that is computationally expensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks. It also incorporates a salt automatically to protect against rainbow table attacks.

## 3. Essential Security Headers

All API responses will include a set of security-related HTTP headers to instruct the browser to enable security features, mitigating risks like XSS, clickjacking, and protocol downgrade attacks.

-   **`Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`**: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
    -   Enforces the use of HTTPS, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
-   **`X-Content-Type-Options`**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    -   Prevents the browser from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared `Content-Type`, which can help prevent certain types of XSS attacks.
-   **`Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`**: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; object-src 'none';`
    -   Provides a powerful layer of protection against XSS by defining which sources of content (scripts, styles, images, etc.) are allowed to be loaded. This needs to be carefully configured for the specific application's needs.
-   **`X-Frame-Options`**: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
    -   Prevents the site from being embedded in an `<iframe>`, protecting against clickjacking attacks.
-   **`X-XSS-Protection`**: `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
    -   Enables the browser's built-in XSS filter. While largely superseded by CSP, it provides a fallback for older browsers.

## 4. Environment Variable Management

Sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and the `JWT_SECRET` must not be hard-coded into the source code.

-   **Strategy:** All sensitive configuration will be managed through environment variables. A `.env` file will be used for local development, and this file will be listed in `.gitignore` to prevent it from ever being committed to version control. In production environments, these variables will be set securely through the hosting platform's configuration.
